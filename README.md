# Sonic 2 Widescreen Hack

This hack works with heyjoeway's GPGX fork (https://github.com/heyjoeway/Genesis-Plus-GX) to make a widescreen hack of Sonic 2 that adds many new features and bugfixes.

As an extra:
Ported S3K's Player_SlopeResist and Player_SlopeRepel, but modified slightly to display the walking animation if you rollstop on a slope
This is only used if physics mode is set to S3K.
